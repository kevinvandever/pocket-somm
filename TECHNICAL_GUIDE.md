# Technical Guide: Creating MCCNO Handbook Assistant Application

This guide will walk you through the process of creating the MCCNO Handbook Assistant application, a chatbot interface for MCCNO handbook inquiries. The application is built using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and integrates with MindStudio for AI-powered responses.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Node.js and npm installed on your computer
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
- Access to a MindStudio account and API key

## Step 6: Create the ChatBot Component

Create a new file `src/ChatBot.tsx` for the chatbot functionality. This component is crucial as it handles the interaction with the MindStudio API:

```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { Send, X, Loader, AlertCircle } from 'lucide-react';

// ... [Rest of the ChatBot component code] ...
```

### Key Aspects of the ChatBot Component:

1. **State Management**: 
   - `messages`: Stores the conversation history.
   - `input`: Manages the user's current input.
   - `isLoading`: Indicates when a response is being fetched.

2. **MindStudio API Integration**:
   - The `sendMessage` function is responsible for sending requests to the MindStudio API.
   - It uses the fetch API to make POST requests to the MindStudio endpoint.
   - The API key is included in the Authorization header.
   - The request body includes the app ID, user input, and workflow name.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implements a retry mechanism (up to 3 times) if the API request fails.
   - Displays error messages to the user if all retries fail.

4. **UI Components**:
   - Renders the chat interface with message history, input field, and send button.
   - Uses Lucide React icons for better visual feedback.

5. **Accessibility and UX**:
   - Implements auto-scrolling to the latest message.
   - Allows sending messages with the Enter key.

## MindStudio Integration Details

The ChatBot component interacts with MindStudio using the following configuration:

1. **API Endpoint**: `https://api.mindstudio.ai/developer/v2/apps/run`
2. **API Key**: Stored in the `API_KEY` constant (should be kept secure in a production environment)
3. **App ID**: `228d9800-1ac7-4e74-8774-cccc0000baf4`
4. **Workflow**: `handbookChat.flow`

### How it Works:

1. When a user sends a message, the `sendMessage` function is called.
2. It constructs a request to the MindStudio API, including:
   - The user's input (`question`)
   - The app ID and workflow name
3. The API processes the input and returns a response.
4. The response is added to the message history and displayed to the user.

### Important Considerations for MindStudio Builders:

1. **API Key Security**: In a production environment, never expose your API key in the frontend code. Use environment variables and a backend service to securely manage API keys.

2. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage API failures gracefully.

3. **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of any rate limits on the MindStudio API and implement appropriate throttling if necessary.

4. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the integration with various inputs to ensure the AI responds appropriately in different scenarios.

5. **Customization**: The current implementation uses a specific app ID and workflow. You may need to adjust these based on your MindStudio configuration.

By understanding these key components and their interaction with MindStudio, you can effectively customize and extend the MCCNO Handbook Assistant application to meet your specific requirements.
